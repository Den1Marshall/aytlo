          Our mission is to make AYTLO a well-known brand outside the NFT
          community, for which we plan to scale. In our team there are people
          with experience from indie game studios to producing videos of famous
          musical performers. We intend to provide a high-quality animated
          series at a high level.

          AYTLO is an emerging brand, and as for any brand, an important aspect
          is to make the brand known. In order to make the brand more
          recognizable, we plan to establish cooperation with prominent people
          from the music and film industry. Of course, we're also mindful about
          the development of our social networks, which are our representation.

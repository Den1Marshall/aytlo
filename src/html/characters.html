          HEAT - Until recent times AYTLO was his territory, but now, because
          the JUMPER wants to control the spot, he has to resist him. He stand
          out in close-in fighting because of his strength, speed and agility.
          The sweat on his palms contains nitroglycerin, which he can ignite to
          create fireballs.

          ASURA - his goal in AYTLO is to take control of the territory. He was
          weak since childhood, went through all the difficulties at the expense
          of the evil energy that engulfed him. He does not stand out in a
          fight, but adjusts to the opponent, becoming the opponent himself.
          When people fight with the ASURA, they fight with themselves.
